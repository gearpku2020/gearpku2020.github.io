I completed my M.S. in Environmental Public Health at Peking University, where I also received my undergraduate training. My research interests include environmental epidemiology and epigenetic epidemiology. My master’s thesis examined the impact of air pollution on sleep quality among middle-aged and older adults and explored the underlying DNA methylation mechanisms.
