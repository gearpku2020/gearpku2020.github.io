I received my undergraduate training in Environmental Biology at the University of Toronto. I am currently pursuing a Master of Sustainability at the University of Sydney and working as a research assistant in environmental health research.
My academic interests focus on environmental health and sustainability, particularly the links between environmental exposures and population health.
