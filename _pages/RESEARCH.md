Preventing health risks associated with the environment is a central objective of environmental health research. Elderly individuals, being a susceptible demographic to environmental hazards, hold significant implications for environmental hygiene by identifying factors influencing their health and survival status. The World Health Organization notes that nearly 25% of the global burden of chronic diseases and mortality is attributable to environmental factors. Moreover, foundational research confirms aging as a primary risk factor for disease progression. Therefore, it is conjectured that besides natural aging, exogenous abnormal aging induced by the environment, termed "Environmental Aging," may serve as a critical pathway for various age-related diseases induced by environmental factors <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8622756/">(Gao et al., 2021, Nature Aging). </a>Investigation into environmental aging necessitates prioritizing the complex pollutant characteristics of environmental pollution and their spatiotemporal dynamic patterns. Atmospheric pollution, being a preventable environmental risk factor affecting health, exhibits compound exposure effects due to the diverse nature of pollutants, their interactions with weather and climate systems, and their varying health effects with exposure duration and concentration changes. It manifests multidimensional spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, making it an ideal scenario for studying health risks associated with environmental aging. Through examining typical environmental risk scenarios such as exposure to atmospheric pollution, we explore the impacts of multi-pollutant compound exposure and multidimensional spatiotemporal evolution on various age-related health risks, thereby deepening scientific understanding of health risks associated with environmental aging. <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP10391">(Gao et al., 2023, Environmental Health Perspectives). </a>

Our research group specializes in quantitatively assessing environment-induced accelerated aging, elucidating the pathways through which environmental factors contribute to aging-related health risks. By employing rigorous scientific methodologies, we aim to provide insights into the impact of environmental exposures on the aging process and associated health outcomes. Through our focused investigations, we seek to advance understanding in this critical area of research, informing strategies for mitigating environmental aging health risks and promoting healthier living environments.

Our research group specializes in elucidating the role of DNA methylation as a pivotal molecular event in environmental aging. By investigating the dynamic changes induced by environmental exposures, we aim to identify potential molecular targets for precision prevention strategies. Through our efforts, we strive to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying environmental aging, ultimately cont
